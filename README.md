### Introduction

This project explores COVID-19 vaccination and death rates around the world. It’s simply meant to satisfy some of my curiosities about the differences in vaccination rates and death rates among various countries.

It’s also an excuse to build my SQL skills. So I’ll explain how I built the database I’m using and I’ll include my SQL queries as well.

### Data Sourcing

Having Identified the Project goals, I went ahead to get the data. I then downloaded the csv file.

- Data claening - Excel,
- Analysis - SQL
- Visualization - Tableau

Covid-19 Project contains the following datasets:

- Covid Deaths
- Covid Vaccinations
- Concepts applied:

**Excel Concepts**

- Remove duplicate
- Update formating

**SQL Concepts**

- SELECT
- Aggregage Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
- Clauses: JOIN, ORDER BY, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
- Use of CTE, Temporary Tables

**Tableau concept**

- Apply filters
- Marks: colour, Label, Tooltip
- Apply Measure

### Project Goals

- Track Covid19 global numbers
- Percentage Population Infected Per Country
- Global Deaths Per Continent
- Infection rate

### Data Transformation/Cleaning
**SQL Queries**

Total Deaths (By Continent)
